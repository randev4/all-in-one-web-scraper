Post content: We constantly talk in this sub about declutter strategies, because that is the name of the sub right? How to get rid of stuff that's cluttering your life. But once you've been decluttering for a while, do you come with new strategies to make sure you don't end up with as much stuff to begin with?

I know there's a lot of stuff that can't be helped like inheriting someone else's mess, suddenly having to downsize, gifts from others, etc. However, I want to know what are people's strategies to declutter by just reducing the amount of stuff that enters their spaces to begin with.

Here's some that I do or I have planned on doing:

* Clothes: Have a set number of things, and for every purchase, something else has to go out. Since I've been working on decluttering my closet, this makes me scrutinize purchases closely as I keep reducing my closet to things I truly like and wear often.
* Makeup/Toiletries: 1:1 replacement, you only buy a new one once your old one is done or expired. If whatever you're using is not good, just throw it out, re-sell, or repurpose if possible, but don't hang on to it.
* Jewelry/Accessories/Costumes: Use what you have, borrow if possible.
* Food: Go to a grocery store with a list, don't buy just for the sake of buying. Check your pantry and your fridge before you make the list!
* Books: E-Reader when possible, mainly e-books borrowed from the library. Physically borrowing books from the library when the e-book is not available.
* Gifts: To those you are close enough, make sure to tell them to get you consumables, experiences or donations to a charity of your choice! Have a Wishlist at the ready.

Any other strategies, advice or experiences you've had when trying to declutter from the other end? (aka the in, not the out).

Comment by sdhopunk: I stopped buying the vacation souvenirs , shot glasses, beer glasses and beer
coasters.  Last trip I just bought Haribo candies. When shopping on Amazon , I
put items in my wish list and wait a few weeks to see If I really need it.

Comment by rpbm: I don‚Äôt go window shopping. I used to run in the dollar store or big lots and
wander around and buy stuff that was cute or interesting or whatever. Now I
don‚Äôt go in, so I don‚Äôt buy crap I don‚Äôt need.

Comment by -digitalin-: My biggest problem areas are papers, kid stuff, and the random crap that builds
up on the kitchen table and has nowhere to go. Some things I try: - cut down on
shopping in person. If I don't go out, there's less stuff that I suddenly
absolutely have to have. No craft stores, no bookstores. If I do go out
shopping, I often feel like I have to buy something or it'll be a wasted trip.
This isn't true. - Paperless statements and bills. Get on do-not-mail lists. -
cut down on gifts. Tell people no gifts, or have a wishlist on Amazon that has
stuff you actually need, so people don't just give token things you won't use. -
stop buying souvenirs or whatever - Stay off sites like Facebook marketplace
where I'm always looking for a deal - Say no to people giving you free stuff. My
kids will not actually use those opened craft supplies. I won't actually wear
their style clothes. Its hard but it's good to practice. - Avoid stocking up
"just because". A few emergency supplies is one thing, but you don't need
duplicates of everything. - When buying, buy neutral, quality stuff. Having one
set of plates that lasts and can be formal or informal is better than having a
different set for every holiday. Having one or two sets of good sheets is better
than a bunch of different colors/fabrics/seasons. A single good coat is better
than a wardrobe of fast fashion. - Avoid "disposable" things-- single-use
costumes, single-season holiday decor, novelty items, or junky stuff that has to
be stored. - Research every purchase and wait several days before buying to
avoid impulse purchases - don't have pets, kids, or hobbies. Jk, these are all
great. But they do come with their own lists of stuff that have to be managed.

Comment by snoobookeyss: My system isn't perfect but here are some things I've implemented: 1. Sorry if
it's offensive but I try to 'shop like a man'. The men in my life only go out
and shop when they need something. It helps me cut down on shopping for fun. 2.
Every time I think I need something I write it down on a piece of paper and keep
it prominent on my desk. I mull it over every time I glance at it.

  Comment by CorgiSheltieMomma: I call that "mission based" shopping as opposed to recreational shopping. You're
there to get something, you find it or not, then leave. In my experience,
looking at stuff in a store is like going to look at puppies. I'm not going home
empty handed.

    Comment by snoobookeyss: Yeah! When I'm already at the store I can't help but to browse üëÄ but at least
I'm not at the store without a mission

    Comment by Fuzzlekat: Yes!! I write down anything I am shopping for in a list that I keep in my phone
and then price compare/shop online without buying for a long time. Surprisingly
even if you just write down what you want to buy and leave it there (like oh
I‚Äôll buy it in a week), it‚Äôs shocking how much of the time the urge to get it
goes away. Also having a savings goal and tracking no spend days in a planner
helped me a lot to see how often I was buying stuff. Now I am really happy to
see no spend days when I do my weekly look back at the week! I also have
categories of things I only want to receive as gifts. I ask for practical gifts
so most of my nice kitchen stuff has come as a gift from other people rather
than as something I go out and purchase. For clothes I have been not buying and
shopping my wardrobe. I make a Pinterest collage board of the 10 tops I am gonna
wear and the pants I like best for each season. It makes getting dressed easier
and I don‚Äôt spend money because I feel like I get to go shopping when I cycle
new things in. I also don‚Äôt buy new any more because thrift is pretty solid
online.

Comment by Trackerbait: being broke and never shopping is fairly effective

  Comment by Jalapeno023: This has helped me the most in not bringing new stuff home. Stay out of the
store or retail place so I am not tempted to buy.

Comment by LimpFootball7019: I found life is less cluttered with paper and catalogs when I have a shredder
and trash can by the door. Small but mighty.

  Comment by sctwinmom: Process mail the same day it arrives.  Open it, trash/recycle immediately and
organize any remainder into ‚Äúto do‚Äù or ‚Äúto read‚Äù folders.  This will cut down
the volume by 90+%.

Comment by NotSlothbeard: Trash can by the back door. When you bring mail in the house, don‚Äôt even put it
down. Open it by the trash can* and get rid of anything you don‚Äôt need
immediately. *or shredder

  Comment by JLMP23: To top this, we just put a ‚Äòplease no junk mail‚Äô decal on our mailbox. You
wouldn‚Äôt believe‚Ä¶ üôåüèª we haven‚Äôt had any junk mail ‚ò∫Ô∏è just mail that is actually
addressed to us. No flyers, no ads, no stack of papers coming in and sitting in
the foyer everyday. I wish I had done it sooner.

    Comment by Jalapeno023: This works?  I‚Äôm skeptical. Is this in the US? You just put a sign that states,
‚ÄúPlease, No junk mail‚Äù on the mailbox door? I am a bit skeptical because I am
still getting mail for the people we bought the house from in early 2021. Our
name is clearly printed on the inside door of the mailbox. I get mail for all
three. The wife still lives in town, so I forward her mail. Her husband passed
away in 2018. I mark his deceased and put it back in the box. Their son moved
out before the father died, so I mark his, ‚ÄúNot at this address‚Äù.

Comment by StarKiller99: Dana K White stopped going to garage/yard sales.

  Comment by eatshoney: Do you know which book she talked about that?

    Comment by StarKiller99: I know she mentioned it in her blog.

      Comment by eatshoney: Okay, thanks! I've read/listened to a lot of her books but haven't made it over
to her blog yet. I need to check it out.

    Comment by TheTruthfulHarp: On a few of her podcast episodes she talks about how she got into her past
garage sale shopping / selling on eBay and how she got out of it. Highly
recommend the podcast (ads are annoying but it‚Äôs what keeps it free to listen
to).

Comment by Skygreencloud: Put a delay on buying anything.  You have to think about it for a week to a
month depending on the item before you are allowed to buy it.  Amazing how many
things you realise you don't need in the delay time.  I've also spent so much
time and energy decluttering I always contemplate every item that I want to
bring in based on the effort it's taken me to declutter to a nicer feeling
space.  I definitely don't want to slide backwards.

Comment by NotElizaHenry: I don‚Äôt browse or treat shopping as anything other than a task to get done. I do
curbside pickup whenever I can so I don‚Äôt have to go inside stores and see all
the awesome stuff I don‚Äôt need. I buy the majority of my clothes on ThredUp and
Poshmark, and it‚Äôs pretty amazing how much less I‚Äôm tempted to buy things I
don‚Äôt need when they‚Äôre not displayed in perfectly styled models. I never have
to ask myself ‚Äúdo I actually want this, or is the model just really pretty?‚Äù
Honestly though, I ¬†think the biggest thing is I avoid ads at all costs, and I
don‚Äôt look at content that‚Äôs trying to sell me things. No gift guides, no
product review roundups, no ‚Äú10 items everyone should have in their wardrobe.‚Äù I
think a lot of people exist in a kind of constant state of shopping, and it‚Äôs
hard to break out of it if you‚Äôre consuming media that‚Äôs constantly encouraging
you. Edit: I also have no mercy when it comes to gifts. If I don‚Äôt love it, it
gets donated or thrown away. Hardly anybody ever follows up, and when they do, I
lie if necessary.

Comment by Disastrous-Wing699: Historically, it's been poverty, but even when I have money, my biggest
deterrent is cleaning. Whatever I bring in my house must be cleaned eventually.
Is this easy to clean? Do I love it enough to clean it regularly? Most of the
time, the answer is 'absolutely not'. I've also gotten really good at waiting
(poverty again). I notice a problem that needs a solution, but I've rarely been
in a position where I can just go out and buy a solution. So I wait. Sometimes,
the problem is less permanent than I thought it was going to be. Sometimes, I
find a work around that is tolerable. Sometimes, I think of a solution I can
make/do with what I already have on hand. Nine times out of ten, I avoid the
purchase of the original solution altogether.

Comment by Suz9006: Don‚Äôt save things ‚Äújust in case‚Äù like packaging materials and boxes.

  Comment by SpOoKy_sKeLeToN_1998: I am very guilty of this... Especially those fancy boxes that have magnets

Comment by gitsgrl: Step one: Refuse. Product giveaways, free gifts with purchase, special tote
bags, etc, y you don‚Äôt actually want gets refused at the source. At first it‚Äôs
awkward, then it becomes second nature.

Comment by Dazzling_Note6245: Focus on the money you save by not purchasing things rather than the thrill of
getting something new. Keep a running total of that motivates you.

Comment by compassrunner: One in, one out is a good strategy. I don't take the free/bonus item with
purchase if it's not something I will use. I also consider in store where I will
put it away if I buy it. Considering storage needs ahead has stopped a few
purchases.

  Comment by BlueLikeMorning: Yes!!! Every time I buy something, I think, where will this go in my home?

  Comment by ImportanceAcademic43: Storage needs - the reason I have neither air fryer nor ice cream machine.

Comment by SpOoKy_sKeLeToN_1998: How do you do this when you have ADHD? I NEED HELP

  Comment by DisgustingCantaloupe: Have a spouse that counteracts your hoarding tendencies

    Comment by SpOoKy_sKeLeToN_1998: That sounds like torture though lol

      Comment by DisgustingCantaloupe: It helps so much, so much so I've kind of adopted the same mentality. I get SO
stressed by clutter. I feel so much better with less stuff

        Comment by SpOoKy_sKeLeToN_1998: Too bad I've never even had a boyfriend, much less a husband lol Am doomed lol

  Comment by Jalapeno023: Me too!  And the little stuff is killing me. Little samples, stuff inherited
from my parents, stuff with sentimental memories attached, half used candles,
old pictures w/o frames, old decor pillows, old manuals and old books.

Comment by ProfChaos_8708: If I'm tempted to buy something, I take a photo of it or bookmark it or put it
on a wishlist. If I'm still thinking about it a month later, I reconsider. With
impulse buying eliminated, I buy a lot less. It helps with gift giving, too. If
something reminds me of someone, I take a photo and send it to them with a note
"this reminds me of you!" They laugh.... And probably didn't really want the
item anyway, but are glad I thought of them.

  Comment by BrassWaffle: Yes! Bonus points because while you're waiting, it could very well go on sale,
or you're giving yourself a chance to find the best price. I never rush. Black
Friday is coming up so everything that makes the final cut will be cheaper in
the end.

Comment by ignescentOne: For clothes, I have themed hangers - they're slightly different ones for skirts
and pants, short sleaved tops, long sleaved tops, and shells.  I have no spare
hangers, so any new clothes have to replace existing items, and I have to be
able to hang up all the clothes.  (this fails slightly when I manage to shove
another sweater into the sweater cubby, but I at least keep the hanging stuff
under control)

Comment by realmozzarella22: Buy less things.  Don‚Äôt fall for the marketing hype of the consumerism society.
Buy what you really need.

Comment by Seeking_Balance101: US Postal mail -- I spent a total of about two hours this weeks contacting
charities that keep sending me physical mail.   Asked them to stop.  Used their
websites to find their contact info; most had email accounts that I could just
send a brief form letter (copy and pasted to each one); and a few I had to call
a phone number to make my request. Response from all was the same:  "Sorry, we
will remove you from our mailing list, but please understand our mail is printed
in advance and you may continue to receive from us for the next 6 to 8 weeks."
I'm okay with that, as long as the deluge of mail stops sometime.  Just so sick
of always having one or two loose heaps of it in my living space, waiting for me
to flip through and make sure there's nothing important mixed in. Also, someone
recommended [dmachoice.com](http://dmachoice.com) which is a service to tell
advertisters not to send "direct mail ads".  It cost $5  to sign up, but it is
supposed to be good for ten years.  If that helps cut down the mail from "new"
charities that I've never donated to, then I'm happy spending the $5.  Fingers
crossed I have good results from it.

Comment by blackflameandcocaine: I saw a video that said something along the lines of ‚Äúwill this help me become a
better version of me?‚Äù and I‚Äôve definitely taken that into account! I justified
buying makeup because I want to look more put together and have a better
appearance and build up a basic makeup kit so I chose two products (makeup
primer & sparkly clear lipgloss) and purchased them! I don‚Äôt wear makeup often
but when I do, I want to look good so they will last me a long time.

Comment by qqererer: >buy just for the sake of buying That *never* happens.  Every single dollar you
spend has been influenced by all the mass marketing messages that are broadcast
to you everywhere, all the time. I scrutinize all my purchases.  And while I
don't buy a lot of stuff and get dopanine from that, it's incredible how *bad I
feel* for not buying the same said things.  It's pure FOMO, which means that as
jaded as I am, even I am not immune to marketing.

Comment by GreenUnderstanding39: I think identifying your triggers is the first stop. Are you a stressed shopper
that shops on your lunch break? Is Amazon your crutch? Do you love online
shopping late at night? For me, convenience was a huge factor. One click check-
out gets me every time. It's too easy. I need to be able to put in the card
details each time so that the money I am spending feels more real. Same with
food delivery. So, I cancelled delivery app subscriptions, cancelled my prime,
and wiped my phone of these apps including others. My mom is always trying to
give me stuff and I just tell her I don't have the space. Get good at saying no.

  Comment by Disastrous-Wing699: Very good advice!

Comment by CptPJs: do I LOVE it, and what problem does it solve? if I love it, but it doesn't solve
a problem, I can admire it in the shop and leave it there. if it solves a
problem that's already solved but I love it, I can throw away the previous one
and replace it, or leave it in the shop. if I don't love it, but it solves a
problem, I can purchase it and know if I find one I love, it will be replaced
and disposed of. the problem could be "I haven't had a new stuffy in a while and
I have space on my bed for one" but the reason can't be "I love it (and I'll put
it just anywhere because there isn't space)" but adding the idea of Why and not
just "it made my brain go !!!‚Äù has really changed what I bring home

  Comment by Disastrous-Wing699: We're on the same wavelength.

Comment by chartreuse_avocado: I ask myself if I love the item enough to keep it if I downsized to a home half
the size of my current one.  Because downsizing is a future part of my life I‚Äôm
actively planning for. That eliminated 80%+ of my purchases right there that
aren‚Äôt food or a consumable.

Comment by floralbalaclava: Clothes/accessories: I am truly just pretty good at buying only what I truly
need or want a LOT. I am careful about what looks good with what I already own,
what makes me feel comfortable/like me, what I will actually take care of, what
works for my lifestyle. Sometimes, I get it wrong, of course. If I‚Äôm not using
an item I‚Äôll sell it or donate it. I don‚Äôt do 1 in, 1 out unless an item is a
direct replacement, but I do keep an eye on what I‚Äôm not using. For costume
clothes (Halloween, theme parties, etc), I try to work mostly with what I
already have and/or choose items that work with my overall aesthetic. I bought a
pink bandana for the Barbie movie that has done a ton of legwork for other
costumes, theme parties, and honestly normal wear since then. Makeup and other
toiletry products: I‚Äôm pretty careful here. I try to finish a product before I
buy a replacement for it. I also think about what I‚Äôll actually use. I used to
buy a lot of lipstick because I like the idea of it. I realized I don‚Äôt actually
LIKE wearing lipstick very much. I also realized I had a lot of eyeshadow
palettes. I have myself on a long-term low-buy for makeup. I can buy staple
products (concealer, tinted moisturizer, mascara, 2 shades of blush, brow gel,
setting spray, lipgloss) regularly but only when I run out of a current product.
I cannot buy eyeshadow palettes at all unless I actually run out of a shade I
actually use regularly, which I will not for years. Something I‚Äôve also had to
do is ask people not to give me stuff. I have a lot of circular economy friends
and this is great but sometimes I have to be the person who says, ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt
want that thing that made you think of me.‚Äù I also don‚Äôt hesitate to donate
unwanted gifts immediately. Mostly, when I buy things, I think about who I
actually am and if this thing is actually a good fit for my lifestyle. I am
never gonna wear uncomfortable shoes, I have 3 blue eyeshadows and don‚Äôt need 4,
I don‚Äôt have the closet space to store Halloween-specific clothes.

Comment by Font_Snob: I'm probably repeating other comments, but here goes. Stuff: Don't buy something
without knowing where you'll put it. This works for every size from apples to
bookshelves. Food: Create a checklist of your most common items. Make copies and
keep one on the fridge. Check stuff off as you think of it or run out. (We
originally got the idea from [this product](https://www.amazon.com/Knock-
Magnetic-Grocery-9-inches-Original/dp/1601061935?th=1).) Clothes: I learned this
from Greg McKeown's "Essentialism." You sort into two groups: "no" and "Hell,
yeah!" If you aren't eager to wear it, get rid of it for something you *are*
looking forward to wearing. Your other plans are solid. I hope it all goes great
for you.

Comment by Lucky-Statistician20: When I lived in a small 1 BR in the city, I made a 1 in/1 out rule. If I brought
anything home, I had to get rid of something else. I also had to make a rule for
buying clothing. Too many hoodies and t-shirts. I had some of those made into
quilts and had to stop buying new ones.

Comment by RitaTeaTree: Makeup category - I buy at a discount website so I usually buy mascaras and
eyeliners 2 at a time, and buy enough shampoo, and other consumables to get free
shipping.  I limit my purchase of makeup palettes and eyeshadows even if they
are a great deal as I know I have enough of these things already. Craft category
- I am slowly working on finishing all my craft and sewing projects, I have 5
dress lengths and 2 unfinished quilts.  I am on a no buy for fabric even if
thrifted, at least until the two unfinished quilts are done.

Comment by JLMP23: Keep reminding my mother in law that we don‚Äôt need anything, and that the kids
don‚Äôt need a box of tchotchkes for every occasion/holiday.

Comment by DisgustingCantaloupe: I get rid of like 70% of stuff I get for Christmas prior to bringing it home. It
goes straight to donation bins. I've been transparent with my family about it
and my niece literally just asked for specific things to get me because she knew
I'd get rid of the stuff I didn't want, lol.

Comment by audibahn88: What worked for me is not having Amazon prime! It‚Äôs all cheap garbage usually
anyways. Usually try to avoid most online shopping, but sometimes it needs to be
done. I also try to research whatever I buy and get the highest quality whatever
it is I can afford.

  Comment by qqererer: Watched a recent docu about "Korean Amazon" and the gig economy. It's borderline
slavery, and in my country it's all temp foreign workers (a growing
political/economic/housing issue) doing the worst work, and buy supporting it,
makes all our lives miserable.

    Comment by Creatrix_Crone: Educating myself on how things are made and taking that into consideration
before purchasing significantly limits the stuff I buy. I'm not perfect &
absolutely still buy stuff that's made under questionable conditions but it does
limit the pointless spending - sure this Halloween cup is sparkly and awesome
and I WANT IT but I don't know where it came from or what company I'm supporting
or whether it's going to fall apart after a handful of uses and end up in
plastic mountain at the landfill. If I need a new cup I'll shop around or find a
local maker and get something that I can be fairly confident will last me a long
time. If it just pinged my crow brain, thinking of everything involved before
and after I buy it will bring the oo shiny excitement back down to earth and
I'll move on. It's nearly impossible to only make ethical purchases but if I can
limit how much harm I'm doing unnecessarily it's a win all around.

      Comment by Murderousplantmom: Starting this practice was so eye opening for me. If I need something I don't
have (which is rare), I look at the list of companies with B Corp certification
first. If I can't find something there, I go local (city, province, Canada, US,
then abroad). It has really cut down on unnecessary spending. Food is still
tricky though because fruit is so delicious.

        Comment by Creatrix_Crone: Food is definitely tough! I recently moved to a farm heavy area where local and
seasonal produce is abundant, affordable and way more delicious than imported
stuff from the grocery store but not everyone is that lucky. I was living in a
city when I went through a bad case of morality OCD and had a stretch where I
was living off local apples and like $14 dollar jars of locally made peanut
butter because everything else was "wrong" in some way. I think when it comes to
necessities like food and health and hygiene stuff there's only so much we can
do and hopefully we balance out our impact in other ways.

          Comment by Murderousplantmom: Ha ha morality OCD. I love that. I feel so guilty buying produce out of season
but I tell myself I've been doing environmental work for 25 years so if I
occasionally want frozen strawberries in a smoothie in January then I've paid my
dues.

  Comment by NotElizaHenry: For me, Amazon is actually really helpful. Instead of going to Target for
laundry detergent and being tempted by every cute display I walk by in the way
to the laundry aisle, I just order a bottle on Amazon. Stores are designed to
get you to buy as much as possible so for me it‚Äôs easier to just not go to them.

    Comment by audibahn88: There is self restraint no matter where you shop. I feel Amazon makes it easier
to overspend as you don‚Äôt physically touch what you buy, just a simple
gratifying ‚Äòadd to cart‚Äô click and it‚Äôs already out of sight out of mind until
it shows up. When I go to most stores, I try to not get a cart (unless it‚Äôs
grocery shopping). That makes it easier to not grab extra items.

Comment by EnvironmentOk2700: If I feel like buying something, I think about what must be donated in exchange.
Prevents a lot of impulse purchases.

Comment by doobie12345: Step 1: live alone

Comment by katie4: I‚Äôm a budgeter. ¬†I like to save money to grow my net worth so if I‚Äôm spending, I
better reaaaaally fucking like it!

Comment by Efficient-Quarter-18: No idea. My 9 year old simply conjures cheap plastic junk of unknown origin.
Commenting to follow!

Comment by popzelda: Stop shopping. This is the first and crucial step. If you have to shop, shop at
home extensively first and get creative.

  Comment by pi_whole: I've tried to adopt a "use what I have" mentality which has actually been
surprisingly enjoyable.  I may want to do some fun shopping in a bookstore and
get coffee, but instead I pull a book off my shelf and have tea at home.  It
really feels good to finally use the things I've been collecting for some vague
future time.

  Comment by Southern_Fan_2109: This. Keep it simple. Don't enter stores, quit Amazon Prime, unsubscribe from
store emails and deals, only go shopping when you need something, no browsing
nor shopping for fun. Get what you need and get out.

Comment by WashBounder2030: I like Andrew Mellen's advice in his book, "Unstuff Your Life". His tip is for
every item that you bring into your house, you have to let go of 10 items. I
think it has been very helpful to equal out the consumption process. Every time
I think of buying some new kitchen appliance or gadget online, I think it's
another thing I have to get rid of later. That thought alone deters my impulse
to buy it. Also, I have a very caring older sister who is always offering me
items to take home whenever I visit her. I always say, "No, thank you, I have
enough."

Comment by msmaynards: Simply knowing what clothing I have fits and is in decent condition stopped
anxiety about having enough in its tracks. If I pull out stuff that doesn't work
for the current me it might feel like I need more but if I pull out an outfit,
it fits and there's more in closet/drawer it's very reassuring that I've got
enough. After switching to collecting from accumulating the thrift store hauls
got smaller and curating collections helped me understand what appealed to me
about those mostly useless items. Unless some new item was better than what I
had it stayed at the store. I figured out bulk buys aren't always a good idea. A
Costco pack of paper towels lasted us many YEARS. So we buy a 2 pack elsewhere
that will last about a year. Same with plastic wrap. A little on hand seems to
be necessary unfortunately but don't need 10 pounds of it. I do use monster
amounts of foil and toilet paper though. This one kills me. If something isn't
going to be used then let it go. Particularly hard with hair products but must
be done.

Comment by BlueLikeMorning: Whenever I get given things, gifts but also inheriting stuff, "I thought you
might like this", anything at all, I take a bit to think about if I really,
really want it. And if I don't, it goes straight into the donate box, do not
pass go, do not collect $200. Our biggest weakness was decor, because each new
season I get excited and want to add to the collection. So we've set hard limits
on the amount of decor we can get each year, and practice the one in one out
rule.

Comment by General-Example3566: These are all good ideas

Comment by Murderousplantmom: Approach every purchase with a zero-waste/anticonsumption mindset. Before I buy
something, "how long will I use this for and when it's time to dispose of it is
it trash or recycle or sell?" If it's trash, I find myself envisioning just
throwing cash in the garbage which helps me to not buy stuff I won't use.

Comment by Kelekona: Clothes: have a body where it's almost impossible to get anything "different"
for.  Other than managing to buy a suitjacket with the pockets still basted shut
at the thrift, there's almost nothing that's worth going to that end of the
store for.  Grocery store has a lovely men's section, but there's only so much
of getting the same stuff in different colors I can stand.  I'd really like to
find something I like in the women's section for once. Food: I have this thing
with "winter is coming" and wanting to have enough stuff on-hand that having to
buy more food is optional for the whole season, but I also hate food-waste.  I'm
not organized enough for the zombie apocalypse cosplay, so I just try to keep
the overbuying under control. I let fantasy-self have some things because it
cuts down on the whining to say that she already has something similar.

Comment by ILikeLenexa: Things and Places.  If a thing doesn't have a place, it doesn't get in.  This
prevents me from getting every knick knack designed as a collectible; every
thing that references my favorite hobbys and such.

Comment by LectureSignificant64: When I‚Äôve discovered thrifting a few years ago, it‚Äôs gotten out of control so
quickly‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs really embarrassing, to be honest. I‚Äôm slowly getting a little bit
better. That‚Äôs the strategies that I try to use: - catch and release (if I find
something cool that I absolutely don‚Äôt need, I might put it in the cart, walk
around the store with it and put it back on the shelf before leaving) - do I
really need it? (99% - no!) - what can I get rid off , if I‚Äôll get it? And how?
- where will I store it? (Or display it etc)

Comment by kmurrda: Thank you for sharing those strategies!

Comment by spedteacher91: We don‚Äôt have a lot of house so if too much comes in, eventually some has to go
out or we‚Äôre overrun lol

Comment by Choosepeace: One in, one out! For clothes , decor , etc.

Comment by psychosis_inducing: I am very strict about what I buy. I am also picky about gifts. If I don't like
them, they either get regifted or donated.

Comment by IGotMyPopcorn: I‚Äôve started declining ‚Äúfree gifts with purchase‚Äù that I‚Äôm not absolutely
certain I will use.

Comment by palolo_lolo: Don't go to non grocery stores. At all. Get a new hobby. If you're going to
target don't even take a basket. Then you gotta pickup and carry stuff.

Comment by Chonkin_GuineaPig: I usually take photos and ensure that all of the items are of high enough
quality before introducing them to my space. Switching over to food and digital
purchases over physical items. Not accepting anything but gift cards and cash.
